<p><strong>What is the difference between Logic and Fuzzy Logic?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Logic</strong> (often called classical or Boolean logic) is based on precise, binary reasoning. In classical logic, statements are <span style="color: red;"><strong>either completely true or completely false (i.e., values are 1 or 0).</strong></span> This approach works well for problems that can be clearly defined with exact rules and boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fuzzy Logic</strong> extends classical logic by allowing for degrees of truth. Instead of only true or false, statements can have a <span style="color: red;"><strong>value anywhere between 0 and 1, representing partial truth.</strong></span> Fuzzy logic is useful for dealing with uncertainty, vagueness, and situations where information is imprecise—such as describing something as "warm" or "tall." It is widely used in control systems, decision-making, and artificial intelligence to model real-world situations more naturally.</p>

<p><strong>What is Deterministic and Stochastic?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterministic</strong> refers to processes or systems where the outcome is completely determined by the initial conditions and rules. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Given the same input, a deterministic system will always produce the same output.</strong></span> There is no randomness involved. For example, traditional computer programs and mathematical equations are deterministic.</li>
<li><strong>Stochastic</strong> refers to processes or systems that <span style="color: red;"><strong>involve randomness or probability.</strong></span> The outcome is not fully predictable, even if the initial conditions are known, because there is some element of chance. Examples include rolling dice, weather patterns, and many machine learning algorithms that use random sampling or probabilistic models.</li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hard Computing</strong> refers to traditional computing methods that are based on precise, <span style="color: red;"><strong>deterministic logic and algorithms.</strong></span> It requires exact input data and produces exact outputs. Examples include classical logic, binary arithmetic, and conventional programming.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Soft Computing</strong> is <span style="color: red;"><strong>stochastic</strong></span> i.e it is an approach that deals with approximate models and gives solutions to complex real-world problems where precision is not always possible. It incorporates techniques like fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and probabilistic reasoning, allowing for tolerance of imprecision and uncertainty.</p>

<p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p>
<p>Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships in data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions.</p>
<p>There are different types of machine learning, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns from labeled data, where the correct output is provided for each example.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> The algorithm finds patterns or groupings in data without labeled outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Machine learning is widely used in applications such as image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and more.</p>

<p><strong>What is an imbalanced dataset?</strong></p>
<p>An imbalanced dataset is a dataset where the distribution of examples across the <span style="color: red;"><strong>different classes is not approximately equal.</strong></span> In other words, one class (or a few classes) has significantly more samples than the others.</p>
<p>This is common in classification problems, such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, or rare event prediction, where the event of interest (positive class) is much less frequent than the negative class.</p>
<p>Imbalanced datasets can cause machine learning models to be biased toward the majority class, leading to poor performance on the minority class. Special techniques such as resampling, using different evaluation metrics, or applying specialized algorithms are often needed to address this issue.</p>

<p><strong>What is data leakage and its types?</strong></p>
<p>Data leakage (or "leakage") occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization to new data. It happens when data that would not be available at prediction time is inadvertently used during model training.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Data Leakage:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Target Leakage (or Label Leakage):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This occurs when the training data includes information about the target variable that would not be available at prediction time. For example, <span style="color: red;"><strong>including a feature that is a future value or a direct proxy of the target.</strong></span></li>
<li><em>Example:</em> Using a "discharge date" to predict whether a patient will be readmitted, when the discharge date is only known after the event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Train-Test Contamination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This happens when information from the test set leaks into the training set, often due to improper data splitting or preprocessing before splitting.</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> Normalizing the entire dataset before splitting into train and test sets, causing information from the test set to influence the training process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Feature Leakage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Occurs when features are constructed using information that would <span style="color: red;"><strong>not be available at prediction time, or when features are highly correlated with the target</strong></span>  due to data collection or processing errors.</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> Including a feature that is derived from the target variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How to Prevent Data Leakage:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always split your data into training and test sets before any preprocessing.</li>
<li>Carefully review features to ensure none contain information that would not be available at prediction time.</li>
<li>Be cautious with time-series data and avoid using future information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data leakage can lead to models that perform well in validation but fail in real-world scenarios, so it is important to identify and prevent it during the machine learning workflow.</p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between <code>fit</code> and <code>transform</code> methods in scikit-learn?</strong></p>
<p>In scikit-learn, many preprocessing and transformation classes (like <code>StandardScaler</code>, <code>PCA</code>, etc.) use the <code>fit</code> and <code>transform</code> methods as part of their workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><code>fit</code></strong>: The <code>fit</code> method is used to learn or estimate parameters from the training data. For example, when you call <code>scaler.fit(X_train)</code>, the scaler computes the mean and standard deviation of the features in <code>X_train</code> and stores them internally.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>transform</code></strong>: The <code>transform</code> method uses the parameters learned during <code>fit</code> to modify the data. For example, <code>scaler.transform(X_test)</code> will use the mean and standard deviation computed from <code>X_train</code> to scale <code>X_test</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>fit_transform</code></strong>: This is a convenience method that combines both steps: it first fits the transformer to the data, then transforms it.</p>
