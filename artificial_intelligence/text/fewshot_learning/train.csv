"e also described how disaggregated networking can be used within new rack scale products and microservers; which are part of a new industry initiative called rack scale architecture. We also devoted a large part of Chapter 11 to projections on how advances in networking will provide rack disaggregation using modular components. We speculated that specialized, low-overhead switch fabric technologies may be employed within the rack to meet low-latency and low-payload overhead requirements when using pools of memory that are separate from the CPU resources.",0
