    " Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    " ## What are GANs?\n",
    " GANs are a type of generative model in AI composed of two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—that are trained together in a competitive process. The generator tries to produce fake (generated) data that resembles real data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish real data from fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Use Cases for GANs\n",
    " - Image synthesis and enhancement (e.g., generating realistic images, super-resolution)\n",
    " - Data augmentation (creating additional training samples)\n",
    " - Creating artwork or music\n",
    " - Generating realistic video or audio\n",
    " - Medical imaging (synthetic data generation, image denoising)\n",
    " - Image-to-image translation (e.g., converting sketches to photos)\n",
    "\n",
    " ## How Do GANs Work? (Step by Step)\n",
    " 1. **Generator starts:** The generator creates fake data (e.g., images) from random noise.\n",
    " 2. **Discriminator evaluates:** The discriminator receives both real data and generated (fake) data.\n",
    " 3. **Discriminator learns:** It tries to correctly classify data as real or fake.\n",
    " 4. **Generator improves:** The generator tries to produce better fakes to fool the discriminator.\n",
    " 5. **Adversarial training:** Both networks improve in turns through repeated training steps, making the generator better at creating realistic data and the discriminator better at spotting fakes.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Pros of GANs\n",
    " - Capable of generating highly realistic and high-quality synthetic data\n",
    " - Useful in situations with limited real data (data augmentation)\n",
    " - Flexible, can be adapted to many types of data (images, audio, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Cons of GANs\n",
    " - Training can be unstable and requires careful tuning\n",
    " - Prone to issues like mode collapse (generator produces limited variety)\n",
    " - Discriminator or generator can overpower the other, halting progress\n",
    " - Often require large computational resources and data for best results\n"
