    "## What is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model in artificial intelligence that learns efficient data representations (encodings) in an unsupervised manner. VAEs are widely used for generating new data similar to a given dataset (such as images, text, or audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases of VAEs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image generation and reconstruction** (e.g., generating new faces, handwritten digits)\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection** (identifying unusual or outlier data points)\n",
    "- **Data denoising** (removing noise from corrupted images)\n",
    "- **Semi-supervised learning** (leveraging unlabeled data for classification tasks)\n",
    "- **Molecular and drug discovery** (generating novel chemical structures)\n",

    "## How VAEs Work: Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder Network**:  \n",
    "   Maps input data (e.g., an image) to a lower-dimensional latent space, producing parameters (mean and variance) describing a probability distribution. Assumes gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling**:  \n",
    "   A random sample (latent vector) is drawn from the distribution (using the mean and variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoder Network**:  \n",
    "   The latent vector is passed through the decoder to reconstruct the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loss Calculation**:  \n",
    "   The VAE loss consists of two terms:\n",
    "   - **Reconstruction loss**: measures how well the output matches the original input.\n",
    "   - **KL divergence loss**: ensures the learned latent representations follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training**:  \n",
    "   The encoder and decoder are trained together to minimize the total loss.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Pros and Cons of VAEs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "- Can generate new, realistic data samples.\n",
    "- Latent space is continuous and structured, enabling smooth interpolation between data points.\n",
    "- Principled probabilistic approach (with explicit regularization).\n",
    "- Well-suited for unsupervised and semi-supervised tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Generated samples may be less sharp or detailed compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).\n",
    "- Assumes latent variable distribution is Gaussian, which may limit flexibility.\n",
    "- Balancing reconstruction quality and latent distribution regularization can be challenging.\n",
