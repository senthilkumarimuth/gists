    "Guardrails are essential in generative AI (GenAI) applications to ensure safe, ethical, and reliable output from AI systems. They can be implemented through various approaches such as input validation, output filtering, user authentication, rate limiting, and continuous monitoring. Proper guardrails help prevent misuse, reduce unwanted or harmful content, and increase trust in GenAI solutions.\n"

    " ### Types of Guardrails\n",
    " \n",
    " In GenAI applications, guardrails can be categorized into several types:\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Input Guardrails:** Validate user inputs before processing, ensuring they meet safety, format, or policy requirements.\n",
    " - **Output Guardrails:** Review and filter AI outputs to prevent sensitive, biased, offensive, or unsafe content.\n",
    " - **Process Guardrails:** Enforce authentication, authorization, and rate limits to manage access and prevent misuse.\n",
    " - **Monitoring Guardrails:** Continuously track AI actions for policy violations, drift, or operational issues, enabling prompt intervention.\n",
    " \n",
    " Combining these guardrail types creates a multi-layered approach to managing the risks and responsibilities of deploying generative AI.\n"
