    " - Intuitive interpretation: Measures the probability that, for a randomly selected pair, the model correctly predicts which subject experiences the event first.\n",
    " - Handles censored data: Can be used even when some survival times are censored.\n",
    " - Model-agnostic: Does not require assumptions about the underlying survival distribution or model type.\n",
    " - Widely used: Standard metric for comparing survival models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons \n",
    " - Ignores calibration: Only assesses ranking, not the absolute accuracy of predicted survival times.\n",
    " - Sensitive to ties: May be less informative when there are many tied predicted scores or event times.\n",
    " - Pairwise computation: Can be computationally expensive for large datasets due to pairwise comparisons.\n",
    " - Does not account for time-dependent covariates or dynamic predictions.\n"
