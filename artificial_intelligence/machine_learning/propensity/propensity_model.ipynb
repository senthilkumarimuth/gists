    " ## What is a Propensity Model?\n",
    " \n",
    "Propensity models are statistical or machine learning-based predictive models designed to estimate the probability (or propensity) that an individual will perform a specific action or exhibit a particular behavior in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are widely applied in marketing, customer relationship management, healthcare, and other domains where understanding and anticipating customer or user behavior is valuable. They assign each individual a propensity score—typically a value between 0 and 1—where higher scores indicate a greater likelihood of the target event occurring.\n",
    " \n",
    " In business and marketing, propensity models are often used to predict outcomes such as:\n",
    " - The probability that a customer will purchase a product (propensity to buy)\n",
    " - The likelihood that a user will click on an ad (propensity to click)\n",
    " - The risk that an existing customer will churn (propensity to churn)\n",
    " - The chance someone will respond to a campaign (propensity to respond)\n",
    " \n",
    " Propensity models are commonly built with supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or gradient boosting, where the target variable is binary (event/no event). These models help organizations target resources more efficiently by focusing on individuals most likely to exhibit desired behaviors.\n"
