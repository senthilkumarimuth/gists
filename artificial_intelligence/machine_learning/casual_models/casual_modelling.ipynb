    "## what is causal model?\n",
    "\n",
    " A \"causal model\" is a framework or mathematical model used to describe and analyze cause-and-effect relationships between variables. In machine learning and statistics, causal models help us understand how changes in one variable (the cause) can directly affect another variable (the effect), beyond mere correlation. These models are essential for tasks like predicting the outcome of interventions, policy analysis, and scientific discovery.\n"

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Common assumptions in causal modeling:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. **Causal Sufficiency**: All relevant confounders (common causes of treatment and outcome) are measured and included in the model.\n",
    " 2. **No Unmeasured Confounding**: There are no hidden variables that affect both the treatment and the outcome.\n",
    " 3. **Consistency**: The observed outcome under the actual treatment received is the same as the potential outcome under that treatment.\n",
    " 4. **Positivity (Overlap)**: Every unit has a positive probability of receiving each level of the treatment, given the confounders.\n",
    " 5. **Correct Model Specification**: The functional form of the relationships between variables is correctly specified.\n",
    " 6. **Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)**: The treatment of one unit does not affect the outcome of another unit (no interference).\n",
    " \n",
    " These assumptions are crucial for identifying and estimating causal effects from data.\n"

    "#### What is confounding?\n",
    " \n",
    "**Confounding** occurs when a third variable, known as a confounder, influences both the treatment (or exposure) and the outcome, creating a spurious association between them. In other words, a confounder is a variable that can make it appear as though there is a causal relationship between the treatment and the outcome, when in fact the observed association is (at least partly) due to the confounder.\n",
    " \n",
    "For example, suppose we want to study whether drinking coffee (treatment) causes heart disease (outcome). If age is related to both coffee consumption and heart disease risk, then age is a confounder. Failing to account for age could lead to incorrect conclusions about the effect of coffee on heart disease.\n",
    " \n",
    "In causal modeling, it is crucial to identify and adjust for confounders to estimate the true causal effect of a treatment or intervention.\n"

    " 2. Economics: Predicting the impact of policy changes (e.g., tax reforms) on employment or economic growth.\n",
    " 3. Marketing: Understanding how a marketing campaign causally affects sales, separating true effect from correlation.\n",
    " 4. Social Sciences: Studying the causal impact of education on income or social mobility.\n",
