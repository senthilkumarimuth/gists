    "## What is R-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-squared** (also known as the **coefficient of determination**) is a statistical metric used to evaluate how well a regression model explains the variability of the target variable. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, R-squared is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $SS_{res} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$ (the sum of squared residuals)\n",
    "- $SS_{tot} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$ (the total sum of squares)\n",
    "- $y_i$ = actual value\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_i$ = predicted value\n",
    "- $\\bar{y}$ = mean of actual values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- $R^2 = 1$: The model perfectly predicts all the data points.\n",
    "- $R^2 = 0$: The model does not explain any of the variability in the target variable.\n",
    "- $R^2 < 0$: The model performs worse than simply predicting the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros and Cons of R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Intuitive Interpretation:** Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.\n",
    "- **Widely Used:** Standard metric for evaluating regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- **Does Not Indicate Causation:** A high R-squared does not mean that changes in independent variables cause changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Can Be Misleading:** Adding more variables can artificially inflate R-squared, even if those variables are not meaningful.\n",
    "- **Not Always Suitable:** For non-linear models or models with outliers, R-squared may not be the best metric.\n"

    " ## What is Adjusted R-squared?\n",
    " \n",
    " **Adjusted R-squared** is a modified version of the R-squared metric that adjusts for the number of predictors (independent variables) in a regression model. While R-squared always increases (or stays the same) as more variables are added to the model, Adjusted R-squared provides a more accurate measure by penalizing the addition of irrelevant predictors.\n",
    " \n",
    " Mathematically, Adjusted R-squared is defined as:\n",
    " \n",
    " $$\n",
    " \\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left(1 - R^2\\right) \\frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1}\n",

    " where:\n",
    " - $R^2$ = R-squared value\n",
    " - $n$ = number of observations\n",
    " - $p$ = number of independent variables (predictors)\n",
    " \n",
    " **Interpretation:**\n",
    " - Adjusted R-squared increases only if the new predictor improves the model more than would be expected by chance.\n",
    " - It can decrease if the added variable does not improve the model sufficiently.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Pros and Cons of Adjusted R-squared\n",
    " \n",
    " **Pros:**\n",
    " - **Penalizes Irrelevant Predictors:** Helps prevent overfitting by discouraging the inclusion of unnecessary variables.\n",
    " - **Better Model Comparison:** Useful for comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Cons:**\n",
    " - **Still Not a Guarantee of Causation:** Like R-squared, a high Adjusted R-squared does not imply causation.\n",
    " - **Can Be Negative:** In poorly fitting models, Adjusted R-squared can be negative.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Summary:**  \n",
    " Adjusted R-squared is generally preferred over R-squared when comparing models with different numbers of predictors, as it provides a more reliable measure of model quality.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** MAE is easy to interpret because it is in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "- **Robust to Outliers:** MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE, as it does not square the errors.\n",
    "- **Widely Used:** MAE is a standard metric for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- **Non-differentiable at Zero:** The absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, which can be a challenge for some optimization algorithms.\n",
    "- **Equal Weight to All Errors:** MAE treats all errors equally, which may not be desirable if larger errors should be penalized more.\n"
