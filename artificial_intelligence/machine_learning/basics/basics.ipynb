    "- **Logic** (often called classical or Boolean logic) is based on precise, binary reasoning. In classical logic, statements are <span style=\"color: red;\">__either completely true or completely false (i.e., values are 1 or 0).__</span> This approach works well for problems that can be clearly defined with exact rules and boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fuzzy Logic** extends classical logic by allowing for degrees of truth. Instead of only true or false, statements can have a <span style=\"color: red;\">__value anywhere between 0 and 1, representing partial truth.__</span> Fuzzy logic is useful for dealing with uncertainty, vagueness, and situations where information is imprecise—such as describing something as \"warm\" or \"tall.\" It is widely used in control systems, decision-making, and artificial intelligence to model real-world situations more naturally.\n"

    "   - This happens when information from the test set leaks into the training set, often due to improper data splitting or preprocessing before splitting.\n",
