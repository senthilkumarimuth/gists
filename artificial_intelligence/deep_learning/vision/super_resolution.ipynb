    "# what is super resolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Super-resolution** refers to the process of enhancing the resolution of an image, i.e., generating a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input. This is a common task in computer vision, especially in fields like medical imaging, satellite imagery, and video processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary methods for super-resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classical methods**:\n",
    "   - These methods include interpolation techniques like bilinear, bicubic, or nearest-neighbor interpolation. However, these are limited in the quality of resolution enhancement and often lead to blurry or less-detailed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deep Learning-based methods**:\n",
    "   - **Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN)**: One of the earlier deep learning approaches that uses convolutional layers to upscale images.\n",
    "   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: SRGAN is an example where GANs are used to generate more realistic high-resolution images by training two networks (generator and discriminator) against each other.\n",
    "   - **Deep ResNet-based architectures**: Some super-resolution models use ResNet-like architectures to handle very deep networks and produce sharper, more detailed high-resolution images.\n",
    "\n",
    "These deep learning-based methods outperform classical approaches by generating more realistic and sharper images with finer details."

    "# what is the difference between image resize and super resolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Super-resolution** and **image resizing** both deal with changing the size of an image, but they differ significantly in their approach and the quality of the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Image Resizing**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Resizing involves scaling the image to a different size (upscaling or downscaling) using basic interpolation methods like **bilinear**, **bicubic**, or **nearest-neighbor**.\n",
    "   - **Result**: The output resolution increases or decreases, but the method does not add new details. When upscaling, the result is often blurry or pixelated because resizing methods can only interpolate between existing pixel values, not infer new details.\n",
    "   - **Speed**: Image resizing is computationally inexpensive and fast.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Commonly used for adjusting image size for display or fitting specific dimensions without adding detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Super-resolution**:\n",
    "   - **Method**: Super-resolution uses advanced techniques, often deep learning models like **SRCNN** or **GAN-based** models, to increase the resolution of an image. These models are trained to predict and generate fine details and textures in the high-resolution output that weren't present in the low-resolution input.\n",
    "   - **Result**: Super-resolution generates high-quality, sharp images with more detail compared to simple image resizing. It can infer new information (such as textures or edges) to make the upscaled image look more realistic and less blurry.\n",
    "   - **Speed**: Super-resolution is computationally intensive and slower due to the complexity of neural network models.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Used in applications where high-quality and detailed images are required, such as satellite imaging, medical imaging, and video enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Image resizing** simply stretches or shrinks an image, often leading to pixelation or blurring in upscaling.\n",
    "- **Super-resolution** aims to enhance the image by adding realistic details and textures, producing a sharper and more detailed high-resolution image."
