    " - Simple and intuitive operation; easy to implement and understand.\n",

    " - Limited to matrices of the same shape; cannot be directly applied to matrices of different sizes.\n",
    " - Does not capture relationships or interactions between rows and columns as in standard matrix multiplication.\n",
    " - Not always suitable when a linear algebraic product is required; can be mathematically inappropriate for some applications.\n",
