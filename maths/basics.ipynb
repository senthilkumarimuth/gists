    " ### Pros and Cons of the Fibonacci Series\n",
    " \n",
    " **Pros:**\n",
    " - Simple to understand and easy to implement.\n",
    " - Appears in many natural phenomena and has theoretical significance in mathematics and computer science.\n",
    " - Serves as a foundation for learning recursion and dynamic programming.\n",
    " - Useful in algorithm design, cryptography, and analytics.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Cons:**\n",
    " - Direct recursive implementations can be highly inefficient due to repeated calculations (exponential time complexity).\n",
    " - Not usually practical for all real-world applications; can be inefficient for generating large numbers without optimization.\n",
    " - The sequence grows quickly, leading to large values that may exceed data type limits in some programming languages.\n",
