    "Spark's Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark, the engine powering Databricks, uses lazy evaluation for DataFrame operations. This means that transformations (e.g., filter, join, groupBy) are not executed immediately when defined. Instead, Spark builds a logical execution plan (a directed acyclic graph, or DAG) and defers computation until an action is triggered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are operations that force Spark to execute the plan and produce a result. Examples include collect(), count(), show(), and display()."
