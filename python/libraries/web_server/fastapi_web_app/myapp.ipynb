    "  \n",

    "  You can add middleware using the `@app.middleware(\"http\")` decorator or by using the `add_middleware` method for built-in or third-party middleware classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example: Custom Middleware**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from fastapi import FastAPI, Request\n",
    "  import time\n",
    "  \n",
    "  app = FastAPI()\n",
    "  \n",
    "  @app.middleware(\"http\")\n",
    "  async def add_process_time_header(request: Request, call_next):\n",
    "      start_time = time.time()\n",
    "      response = await call_next(request)\n",
    "      process_time = time.time() - start_time\n",
    "      response.headers[\"X-Process-Time\"] = str(process_time)\n",
    "      return response\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Example: Using Built-in Middleware (CORS)**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n",
    "  \n",
    "  app.add_middleware(\n",
    "      CORSMiddleware,\n",
    "      allow_origins=[\"*\"],\n",
    "      allow_credentials=True,\n",
    "      allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n",
    "      allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n",
    "  )\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Summary:**\n",
    "  - Middleware in FastAPI is simple and powerful.\n",
    "  - Use it for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, CORS, etc.\n",
    "  - You can stack multiple middleware, and their order matters.\n"

    "  ## What is ASGI and WSGI?\n",
    " \n",
    "  **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface):**\n",
    "  - WSGI is a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks.\n",
    "  - It was designed for synchronous applications, where each request is handled one at a time.\n",
    "  - Popular frameworks like Flask and Django (before version 3.1) use WSGI.\n",

    "  **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface):**\n",

    "  - Frameworks like FastAPI and newer versions of Django (3.1+) support ASGI.\n",
    "  - ASGI enables features like WebSockets, background tasks, and long-lived connections, which are difficult or impossible with WSGI.\n",
    " \n",

    " ## Pros and Cons of FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    " **Pros:**\n",
    " - **High Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to its use of Starlette and Pydantic.\n",
    " - **Easy to Use:** Its syntax is intuitive and similar to Python type hints, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    " - **Automatic Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc).\n",
    " - **Type Safety:** Built-in support for data validation and type checking using Python type hints.\n",
    " - **Asynchronous Support:** Native support for async and await, allowing for high concurrency.\n",
    " - **Modern Features:** Supports OAuth2, JWT, CORS, and other modern web standards out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Cons:**\n",
    " - **Young Ecosystem:** FastAPI is relatively new, so its ecosystem and community are smaller compared to older frameworks like Django or Flask.\n",
    " - **Learning Curve for Async:** Developers unfamiliar with asynchronous programming may face a learning curve.\n",
    " - **Limited Built-in Tools:** Lacks some built-in features (like admin interfaces or ORM) that are present in frameworks like Django.\n",
    " - **Deployment Complexity:** Deploying async applications can be more complex, especially for beginners.\n",
    " - **Documentation Gaps:** While the core documentation is good, some advanced use cases may lack detailed guides or examples.\n",
