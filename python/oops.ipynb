    "## SOLID Principles in Python\n",
    "\n",
    " SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):\n",
    "    A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):\n",
    "    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):\n",
    "    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):\n",
    "    No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It is better to have many specific interfaces than a large, general-purpose one.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):\n",
    "    High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    " In Python, these principles guide how you design your classes, interfaces (using abstract base classes), and module structures.\n"
